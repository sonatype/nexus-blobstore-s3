Nexus Repository S3 Blobstores
==============================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers](https://badges.gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers.svg)](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This project adds S3 backed blobstores to Sonatype Nexus Repository 3.  It allows
Nexus Repository to store the components and assets in Amazon AWS S3 instead of a
local filesystem.

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

Go read [our contribution guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get a bit more familiar with how
we would like things to flow.

Requirements
------------

NOTE: Nexus Repository 3.12 now bundles the S3 blobstore plugin and it's no longer necessary to build or install separately.

* [Apache Maven 3.3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Java 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Network access to https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid

Also, there is a good amount of information available at [Bundle Development Overview](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development#BundleDevelopment-BundleDevelopmentOverview)

Building
--------

To build the project and generate the bundle use Maven

    mvn clean install

If everything checks out, the nexus-blobstore-s3 bundle  should be available in the `target` folder


Installing
----------

See `install.sh`.  This copies the nexus-blobstore-s3 jar file to the
right place and updates the configuration files.  Use at your own
risk.

Alternatively, copy nexus-blobstore-s3-*.jar and the AWS SDK bundle
jar into the nexus/deploy subdirectory.

Start the bundle from the Nexus Repository console:

```
bundle:list | grep nexus-blobstore-s3
bundle:start <bundleNumber>
```

Configuration
-------------

Log in as admin and create a new blobstore, selecting S3 as the type.
If any fields are left blank, AWS credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`
will be used.

Building Nexus Docker image with this bundle
--------------------------------------------
```
docker build --rm=true -t nexus-with-s3-blobstore:1.2.1-SNAPSHOT .
```

S3 Bucket Policy
----------------
The AWS user for accessing the S3 Blobstore bucket needs to be granted 
permission for these actions:

* s3:PutObject
* s3:GetObject
* s3:DeleteObject
* s3:ListBucket
* s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration
* s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration
* s3:DeleteObjectTagging
* s3:GetObjectTagging
* s3:PutObjectTagging

Sample minimal policy where `<user-arn>` is the ARN of the AWS user and `<s3-bucket-name>` the S3 bucket name:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "NexusS3BlobStorePolicy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "NexusS3BlobStoreAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "<user-arn>"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration",
                "s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration",
                "s3:DeleteObjectTagging",
                "s3:GetObjectTagging",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<s3-bucket-name>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<s3-bucket-name>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```


Troubleshooting
---------------

How can I remove or fix a misbehaving S3 blobstore?  You may need to
adjust the OrientDB configuration manually to fix it.  Check out this article:
https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/235816228-Relocating-Blob-Stores

For S3 blobstores use 
```
update repository_blobstore set attributes.s3.bucket='newbucketname' where name='mys3blobstore'
```
to adjust the bucket name.

The Fine Print
--------------

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to S3 support
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
